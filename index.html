There may come a time when your business comes across a bump in the road and has to change its plans to fit a specific situation. If you’re not able to adapt and deal with change, one tough situation might be the reason your business goes under. Being adaptive will help your business do well in the long run and will allow you to overcome hiccups more smoothly. It also teaches you how to handle situations that might not go as originally expected. </p> <br> <p>One company that handles changing situations particularly well is Netflix. Netflix started up as an online DVD rental company in 1998. Along with their head competitor, Blockbuster, they mailed DVDs to subscribers around the country. Demand was very high for DVD rentals in 2005, but other companies were starting to turn to alternative methods. Two years later, they later decided to start a streaming service. At this time, other companies were turning away from the traditional rental DVD format and Netflix was making leaps and bounds in the entertainment industry.</p> <br> <p>Sarandos, the head of Netflix’s content said “We never spend one minute trying to save the DVD business,”. Netflix must have recognized that the people did not favor this method of movie watching anymore. By changing Netflix’s company to accommodate the times of changing technology, it has allowed their company to prosper. Their competition, Blockbuster, chose to keep their main focus on the traditional, mail-in format of their business. Later, in 2014 they closed because of companies like Netflix, which made movie-watching more convenient and less costly for the average person.</p>

Its global influence caused the world to question the authority and trust given to banks. Despite this, even during this great recession, Boeing was able to thrive. Not much later in the mid-30’s the government saw it unfit that corporations be able to build and fly planes at the same time. With this Boeing lost its founder, and roughly 50% of its business.</p> <br> <p>Despite this all, Boeing is one of the most successful and well known companies behind commercial airlines and flying today. It was only able to continue due the corporations will to survive. During the great-depression they were able to push through, and just when they felt they were at their worst, they were attacked again. Through all this they managed to triumph. Had anyone who managed the direction of the company lost hope, it’s likely that Boeing would not exist today.</p> <br> <p>Now with all this in its past, Boeing has the experience necessary to be a leader in the business world. The sheer willpower used to keep the company afloat during the hardest of times is incredibly impressive to any onlooker. It would be surprising to see such a titan of the industry fall, even with the hard times it has fallen on in the pandemic as of late. Even now they simply rough through it.</p>

Apple has seen much of its success due to a practice largely endorsed and founded by themselves. Vertical Integration is the practice of building and manufacturing tools that you need to make a product. The less a company relies on outside businesses for its production, in any way, the more “vertically integrated” a company is.</p> <br> <p>This can be seen in many Apple products, but is particularly exemplified in the new release of the M1 MacBooks in 2020. With this new release, all future MacBooks will likely be using M1 processors. This allows Apple to have a better hold on its production pipelines, and better scale its development based on demand, and other factors. Apple has been doing this for many years, if not most of its life, and is a major contender as to why the corporation is one of the most well known and successful companies in the world. </p> <br> <p>Apple is known as one of the smartest companies, not just by other companies due to its smart practices, but to the everyday individual as well. Apple treats its customers in a way that makes them feel coddled and protected. Making them more likely to trust and stay with the product. Using this they also encourage consumers to repeatedly buy new phones every year, despite most studies saying that doing so is wasteful and unnecessary. Apple is the pinnacle of smart management, and it shows.</p>

<div class="content"> <div class="link-to" id="create"></div> <h1>Creative</h1> <div class="img-container"> <img class="inline-img" src="/Success-PW/disney.ea9b4e82.png" alt="Steamboat Willie and Walt Disney"> <p>Creativity pushes Walt Disney to success</p> </div><p>Creativity is crucial to making a company unique. When a business is unique, it draws customers in and makes it harder for your competition to compete with you or “one-up” your business. Having an imaginative mind can also teach you to be a good problem solver and will push you to achieve your goals. It will help you be able to think on your feet and to think of solutions when you come across a tough situation. Walt Disney was a great role model in terms of being creative and imaginative. For example, his career started off as a newspaper artist where he made cartoons for peoples’ daily mail.</p> <br> <p>Through that job at the Pesman Art Studio, Walt Disney ended up making connections with other people who led him to his next job where he helped make commercials based on cutout animation. Following that job, he became very passionate about experimenting with a camera and cel animation.</p> <br> <p>Because Walt Disney was outgoing and willing to try new, creative things, it led him to make new connections with others who bettered him and pushed him further into his career. By using his creativity from an early standpoint in his career, it allowed him to succeed as a business owner. This is because he used what he already knew and expanded on it. Things like “Laugh-o-grams” and the first-ever cartoons with music in the background drew customers in because they wanted to know what the “next big thing” was and were always looking forward to new ideas. By taking his cartoons to different mediums, each of those new ideas helped him reel in customers and become more well known.</p>
